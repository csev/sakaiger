<h3>The Legend of the Sakaiger</h3>
(Under construction)
<p>
The Sakaiger is a happy dancing creature.  It is the logo of the hip, cool, underground, karaoke singing, 
silly elements of the Sakai Community (that is pretty much everyone).  The Sakaiger is very much part of the lore
of the Sakai Quality Assurance effort.

<li>Andrew Thornton of CARET / Cambridge designed the original Sakaiger image.
<li>Each stuffed Sakaiger is hand sewn in Perry, MI
(<a href=http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=n+church+st+vernon+mi&sll=42.939397,-84.032364&sspn=0.018693,0.025706&ie=UTF8&om=1&ll=42.940214,-84.030819&spn=0.037386,0.051413&z=14&iwloc=addr target=_new>Map</a>).  
The stuffed Sakaiger is based on a Simplicity 3779 pattern for a stuffed rabbit (www.simplicity.com) - the pattern was adapted to make the Sakaiger more tiger-like.
<li>It is not possible to purchase a Sakaiger at this time - they are only available as gifts.

<h3>Notes</h3>
From Harriet: The original concept of a Sakaiger was mainly a silly pun thought up by
those crazy folks at CARET, Cambridge. We have intermittently talked about
other Sakai related animals (Sakainocerous, for example), but none of them
really caught on as the Sakaiger did. We wanted to have a real
implementation of a Sakaiger, and Andy Thornton drew one, which ended up
looking rather like the tiger from the Weebls cartoon 'Kenya'.  
Andy also bought a Weebl tiger and lion (and t-shirt) for the office.  We
customised our Weebl tiger a bit with a Sakai badge in its ear... The real
life Sakaigers as realised by Chuck don't look much like the Weebl one
(except they're clearly both meant to be tigers) - the Sakaiger is much
taller and thinner and is smily.
